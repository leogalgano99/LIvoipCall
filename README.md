This repository simulates a 5G network using Open5GS and UERANSIM. The project is configured for macOS but can be easily adapted to any OS. An Asterisk server acting as a SIP Server was inserted into the Open5GS network and through UERANSIM the Python PJSIP library was installed. OpenLI was used for legal interception and the whole thing can be simulated simply in a few steps.
